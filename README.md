# My Contributions to the #30DayChartChallenge 2022
The challenge details can be found in their [repo](https://github.com/dominicroye/30DayChartChallenge_Edition2022) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/30DayChartChall).

## Code
Feel free to check out my code to copy, modify and reuse under MIT license. I learned a lot during the challenge and want to giv back to the community, from which I learned so much.

## Data
I will not host the used data on this repository, but provide the source and cleaning scripts wherever possible. As I used some datasets for multiple plots, I provide separate cleaning scripts in the `data_cleaning` folder.
